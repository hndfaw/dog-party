~- `Challenge` The background image (Park Image) needed to get darker, I tried to add another dive on top of it and add balck background with 0.5 oppacity, but it was not a good approach because I would need to change the display of some elements to absolute or fixed.~

~`Solution` I change the opacity of Park Image in photoshop to 0.5.~

`ok` I changed this solustion by using the original image and adding a new layer on the top of it using CSS with the black background-color and opacity of 0.5.
